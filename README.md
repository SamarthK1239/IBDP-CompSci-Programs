# IBDP-CompSci-Programs
These are some important programs learnt during the programming unit of the IBDP Computer Science course.

Some of these programs refrence others in the same project. These references are listed in the comments at the very top of each of the programs, with the purpose of the program. Be sure to have the files in the same directory or you'll end up having a bad time.

Have fun! This repository will be updated constantly until the course is over.
